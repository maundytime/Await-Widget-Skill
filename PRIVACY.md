# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 22, 2026

This policy applies to Await, its widget extension, and the Await Widget Skill.

## Summary

Await is a local-first widget workshop app. The app does not use developer-operated accounts, advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, or tracking SDKs.

Most data stays on your device. Some features can send data to Apple services or to network endpoints used by the widgets you create or add.

## Data Stored On Your Device

Await may store the following data locally:

- Widget source files, generated widget bundles, imported assets, and exported widget folders.
- Widget state saved through `AwaitStore`.
- App settings, preview preferences, permission status-related state, and cached purchase entitlement state.
- A recent now-playing media snapshot for widgets that display media state.
- Cached remote images used by widgets.

This data is stored in the app container or the shared app group container so the main app and widget extension can both access it.

## Permissions

Await requests permissions only when a feature or widget needs them.

Depending on the widgets you use, Await may process:

- Location data, used for location-aware widgets and weather widgets.
- Weather data from Apple WeatherKit, based on coordinates provided by the app or widget.
- Calendar events, including event titles, dates, calendar names, locations, notes, and URLs.
- Reminders, including reminder titles, notes, dates, completion state, priority, and list names.
- Health data, currently step count, walking/running distance, and flights climbed.
- Apple Music or media library access, used for music and now-playing widgets.
- Alarm access, used to schedule widget-related alarms or timers.
- Files or folders you explicitly import or export through the system document picker.

Permission-protected data is used to render widgets or perform the action you requested. Await does not sell this data or use it for advertising.

## Network Requests

Await can make network requests in these cases:

- StoreKit requests to Apple for purchases and purchase restoration.
- WeatherKit requests to Apple for weather data.
- Apple Music catalog requests for music metadata and artwork.
- Remote image loading for widget rendering.
- Requests made by widgets through `AwaitNetwork`.

When a widget makes a request, the destination service receives the request data according to that service's own privacy policy. Only use widgets from sources you trust when privacy matters.

## Purchases

Await uses Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases. Purchase processing is handled by Apple. Await stores only the local entitlement state needed to unlock purchased features.

## Sharing And Export

You can export widget folders or import folders through the system document picker. Exported widgets may contain editable widget files, assets, and other files you placed in the widget folder. You control where those files are shared.

## Deletion

You can delete widgets and their local stored data from within Await. Deleting the app also removes app-local data from the device, subject to OS behavior for system-managed purchase records and external copies you exported.

## User-Created Widgets

Await lets you create widgets based on your own preferences. Depending on the features you choose, a widget may use local widget files, store local widget state, access supported permission-based features, or make network requests to services you configure.

Only use widgets from sources you trust when privacy matters.

## Changes

This policy may be updated when Await's behavior changes. The date at the top shows the latest update.
